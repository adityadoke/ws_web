# ws_web
Application part of a demo for deploying containers to Amazon EC2 Container
Services (ECS)

## Setup

This application requires the
[wercker/ws_api](https://github.com/wercker/ws_api) project as dependency.  To
run this application locally, download the [wercker
cli](http://wercker.com/downloads) and run the `wercker dev` command in the
project directory.

Wercker will then spin up the required containers and allow you to run the
application with it's dependencies locally.
